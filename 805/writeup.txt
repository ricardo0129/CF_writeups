Final Standing: 342
Accepted: A,B,C,D,E,F
Reflection: I had a very strong performance in this contest gaining enough rating to become an expert. 
My thought process was very fast and organized and only took a bit long on question F. I had the right 
thinking but over complicated the solution. 
Moving Foward: Unfortunalty this was a division 3 which I should be doing very good in so this means
I need a lot more division 2 practice to improve.
