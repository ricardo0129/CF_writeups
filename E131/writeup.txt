Final Standing: 1611
Accepted: A,B,C
Reflection: In terms of time one of my strongest performances ever. Solved all three problems within 25 mins. This gave me a really good ranking, I was very 
close in finishing up my solution from D but was missing one last part to my greedy solution. I correctly modeled the problem as interval matching, but 
my solution failed at some test cases. 
Moving Foward: I will have to see what part of D I missed but overall a very strong effort and I hope to continue like this.
