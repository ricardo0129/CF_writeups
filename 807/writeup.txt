Final Standing: 2152
Accepted: A,B,C
Reflection: Contest got off to a good start made some very quick observations
on A & B got them in under 10 mins. With C I took a little longer than I should
have since I didn't read the constraints correctly which made me come up with
a time complexity that wasn't needed. Problem D I was unable to get there was
observations that I wasn't able to come up with. 
Moving Foward: Solve more binary string problems since they are one of my
downfalls.
